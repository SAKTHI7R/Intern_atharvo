# Hair Density Estimator

## Overview

The Hair Density Estimator is a Python application that utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and OpenCV (cv2) for image processing to estimate the density of hair in a given image. The application allows users to upload an image, processes it to estimate hair density, and displays the results in a simple GUI.

## Features

- Upload an image of the scalp or hair area.
- Process the image to detect and analyze hair density.
- Display the estimated hair density in the GUI.

## Requirements

- `tkinter` (for the GUI)
- `opencv-python` (for image processing)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)

You can install these dependencies using the following `requirements.txt` file:
